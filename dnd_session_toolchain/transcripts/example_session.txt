DM: The group reaches a ruined watchtower after following clues from last session.
Player 1: I examine the carvings near the entrance and look for hidden symbols.

Player 2: I keep watch while Player 3 searches for tracks around the tower.
DM: You discover evidence that someone left recently and headed east.
Player 3: We record everything and decide to investigate the eastern road next.

The quality of the character made with the style is too similar with the quality of the characters.
I don't know if that is that.
It's got the role materials for it, right?
Like, sword us is not a role material.
Yeah, that's true.
That would be funny.
I tell them the ability I can do that.
Yeah, the child was the ability to do that.
Only presumably not for wood.
Can you do that for wood too?
If so, how you should?
I can do it.
If I have a proud sword us and the ira in the ira.
Because it...
It crashed a not magical item.
It must include some metal.
Oh!
This...
The economy had fully engaged.
So, like...
I mean, it's like...
Yeah, set of tools or something.
So, yeah, you just need to have...
And...
But...
But...
But after the ritual, this will kind of metal.
That is...
That is...
Oh, never mind.
I wouldn't even need the sword us.
Because it's literally just...
You...
Lay out metal equal to the worst of the object.
And then you turn that metal into the object.
That includes metal.
That is cheating.
Bro, what's here?
In date...
Can't devils...
Arch devils...
And was their contracts and rules.
Although they've liked too much like the gods.
I am...
I can see...
I can see the...
The community...
You have to think about that.
I have to think about that.
But yeah, basically...
Nothing was that for today.
I still have three fabricates.
And then keep trying to devils.
Yeah, so...
Yeah, to be honest, I'm still trying to work out how...
How...
I'm gonna work...
Like how I'm working pallidins.
And...
Like I didn't think about this stuff when I came up with a storyline.
I came up with a storyline, like...
Without any knowledge.
That's the idea.
That's the idea.
And with that...
And then...
And then...
And then I was like...
How...
How...
I was like...
How...
How...
How...
I was like...
How can I bend D&D to my story?
More than I was like...
You know...
How can I create that story?
Yeah.
How can I create that story?
From D&D?
Yeah.
That's what it became.
Yeah.
And eventually I gave up.
And it was like...
Oh my gosh.
I was like...
Oh my gosh.
It was like...
It was like...
It was like...
I heard...
Do my...
the...
The...
The...
The...
The...
The...
I...
Yeah.
That's...
The...
The...
The...
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So...
For a moment of background.
This is...
Like...
Like...
Like...
In...
In...
Yeah.
The...
The...
The...
Wisdoms right on again.
The entire art.
And nobody.
Nobody to anything I've had.
Um...
The...
The...
The...
They...
They...
The...
Maybe they can do...
Also...
And it's...
Everything sucks.
I...
Yeah.
Everything sucks.
I don't know anything.
So...
How did you get used?
We're going to have an entity for one century.
Where?
Where?
We just don't want that out to take a break of the people's jobs by adding.
And of course, the wizards really hate that.
It was a swivist start.
Basically, we're going to get the power to the guilds.
The guilds.
Of the trade.
So we're going to develop a trade.
We're going to have a break.
We're not going to have wizards just like that.
We're going to have a break.
So it's only everything's made that actually.
And of course, wizards didn't like the sort of, throughout our total, social media, we're trying to get around the walls.
For a great army, a magic to enrich themselves.
And that's a fantastic idea.
So a magic.
Like a magic.
Oh, magic.
Why are you saying that?
That's exactly what you're going to like find the...
The broken shit.
I'm kind of glad I didn't start recording it like resume recording it because this would just confuse the shit out of it.
Because we wanted to, we wanted to learn to recognize when you're talking about the game and when you're talking about other stuff.
And like use like a user-trail model.
Like, so it's like, it'll assume a lot of things, but bring up things that you can say is a part of it or not.
Yeah, this is a sum of my part of it.
Yeah, it would be very confusing that I would just have to teach it.
That's part of another campaign.
And then we're going to be talking about like Russia or something and it's going to be like, is this part of another campaign?
Like this Russian person, this Putin person is going to nuke this person.
But I feel like the more it listens to the sessions, the better it will get.
But yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, exactly.
I think I have a little bit of a guess of us.
Have you eaten yet?
Uh, a little more you need to have a session.
Yeah.
I think it's like a session.
A session.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't know what to do with you.
Okay.
I'm actually doing this.
I'm saving this one.
I'm saving this one.
Yeah.
And my mother's will put it into the, I'm just going to put it into the transcripting heart first.
I think it's called whisper or something.
Oh, it's going to take long.
I've found that there is also a transcripting ball tools for the, for the physical disorder.
But it basically, you, you've already seen to be our first general and you need to.
